        <div class="Data">
            <h2 id="h2">What is Data?</h2>
            <p id="p2"> Data are basically sets of unprocessed information and raw figures without context. It is a collection of bits and bytes that are saved and shared through a digital medium. Any computerized information, including knowledge representations, is considered data (Chen et al., 2009). One thing about data is that it can be gathered anywhere, be it through your neighbor, surroundings, or even by simply looking at a particular object. There is no limitation in gathering data, since there can always be data gathered everywhere. Data can also be represented in various ways, may it be geometric or numeric, static or dynamic</p>
        </div>

        <div class="Information">
            <h2 id="h3">What is Information?</h2>
            <p id="p3"> Information is data that was stored, analyzed, communicated, and displayed in multiple ways. It is a collection of processed data that’s been organized and structured into context so that people can understand and easily comprehend it. Additionally, information creates meaning for the data gathered and serves as a basis for knowledge (Liew, 2007). Without data there would be no information, and without information there would be no basis for knowledge. Hence, data, information, and knowledge are all interconnected with one another</p>

            <h2 id="h4">What are Information Systems?</h2>
            <p id="p4">Information systems is a functional area that deals with planning,  developing, and managing data to provide useful information to users/people who perform tasks regarding information processing and management (Rainer et al. 2020). Information systems encompass a set of interrelated components that supply information to people. These system components contain the hardware and software, as well as the peopleware, or user.</p>

        <div class="DTIS">
            <h2 id="h5">Different Types of Information Systems</h2>
            <p id="p5">There are various types of information systems that help people in different organizations and sectors. These information systems help people in processing data and providing useful information for decision-making and other tasks. Some of these information systems are Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Management Information Systems (MIS), Decision Support Systems (DSS), and Executive Information Systems (EIS) (Rainer et al. 2020).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="TPS">
            <h2 id="h6">Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h2>
            <p id="p6"> A transaction processing system, also known as a “TPS,” is a type of information system that supports a firm’s business transactions. This processing system maintains the stability of a business, ensuring that the organization is running smoothly. It automates high volumes of paperwork such as customer statements, invoices,
                payment reminders, etc. (Mahar, 2003)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="MIS">
            <h2 id="h7">Management Information System (MIS)</h2>
            <p id="p7"> A management information system (MIS) is a system distinction used to store records, information, and login/logout details of an employee in a company. It is usually utilized by a department that oversees client and worker data. It provides information in the form of prespecified reports and displays to managers and man business professionals (O’Brien et al., 2011)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="DSS">
            <h2 id="h8">Decision Support System (DSS)</h2>
            <p id="p8">A decision support system (DSS) is a high-level information system that provides assistance to high-ranking business officials when it comes to making decisions. It provides information and decision support techniques that analyze specific problems or opportunities through interactive ad hoc support for the decision-making processes of managers and other business professionals. Through DSS, businesses and organizations can ensure calculated risk and an efficient overall quality of decision-making (O’Brien et al., 2011).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="KMS">
            <h2 id="h9">Knowledge Management System (KMS)</h2>
            <p id="p9"> A knowledge management system is a type of information system that was developed to enhance knowledge management processes. These systems mainly function as a help desk for users that provides possible answers to the user’s queries and problems. There are multiple definitions as to what a KMS is; however, it mainly revolves around the creation of knowledge repositories, the improvement of knowledge access and sharing, as well as communication through collaboration, enhancing the knowledge environment, and managing knowledge as an asset for an organization, which becomes easier (Igbinovia, 2018).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="EIS">
            <h2 id="h0">Executive Information System (EIS)</h2>
            <p id="p0">Executive information system (EIS) is a system designed for executives or high-level management in a company. It displays graphics and reports about the entire business of a company and aims to enable high-level stakeholders to make calculated decisions (Satiewan et al., 2024). This information system is tailor-fit to leaders and high-ranking officials in a business/organization</p>
