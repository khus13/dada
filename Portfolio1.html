        <h1>Computer Science as a Discipline </h1>
        <p id="p1">Computer science is an interdisciplinary field that involves computation, developing algorithms, machine learning, and the implementation of artificial intelligence. This field is broad, encompassing both scientific and engineering aspects that aim to provide a solution to certain problems (Hazzan et al., 2020). Through computer science, various software have been developed and multiple systems have been created, which are utilized by people and large businesses in their day-to-day settings.</p>

        <h2 id="h2">Computing Major and Fields</h2>
        <p id="p2">There are various computing fields and majors that make up the tech industry. These fields and majors are unique in their own way. Despite their differences, these fields work in ways that strive to innovate the world. Some of these computing fields are computer science, information technology, information systems, computer engineering, software engineering, etc.

It is also the discipline that bridges the gap between different majors. This discipline applies to various fields, including business, medicine, and engineering, by integrating them with technological aspects.</td>
